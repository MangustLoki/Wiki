### Welcome to the TerraformGenerator wiki!

This is the official wiki for the [TerraformGenerator](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/terraformgenerator-alpha.75132/) plugin. This should provide you all the necessary information you need to setup and configure the plugin.

*The plugin is currently in alpha, a bunch of these things may be subject to change*

### Introduction 
TerraformGenerator is a world generator plugin that aims to provide an enhanced vanilla feel. The world is playable with all vanilla items obtainable, though I will heavily recommend thoroughly testing it for yourself before deploying it to a production environment. Pregeneration will take a while as the plugin generates more slowly than vanilla, making small mistakes difficult to fix later on.

### Disclaimer
If you find any bugs, feel free to report it either on the **Issues** section here on github or on **Discord**. Any form of feedback or criticism would be appreciated.
