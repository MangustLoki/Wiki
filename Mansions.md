# Mansions

Massive dungeons that spawn in dark oak forests. They can contain many different types of rooms, and will spawn a mass of Vindicators and Evokers. Killing these defenders will not cause them to respawn. Mansions have 3 levels, the ground floor, the second floor, as well as a closed-off attic.

## Ground floor Rooms

### Grand Stairway
