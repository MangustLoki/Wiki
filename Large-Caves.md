# Large Caves

Can spawn in any biome.

## Generic Large Cave

Large carving that has stalactites and stalagmites. Will have a shallow pool of water on the ground, with some sea pickles inside. Stalactites and stalagmites currently don't spawn ores, though the cave carving itself may expose ores.

This screenshot includes torches behind the stalactites and stalagmites. These torches don't spawn naturally and the cave is normally almost in complete darkness.
