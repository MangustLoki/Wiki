## Standard Village House

The staple of all villages. Standard Village Houses come in a few different variants and will always contain at least one bed. Small libraries and kitchens can spawn inside standard village houses and provide for librarians and butchers.

## Forge

Forges always spawn with a chimney that contains a blast furnace. Larger forges can contain stone cutters and smithing tables, along with blacksmith loot.

## Temple

Temples will always spawn a brewing stand within them.

## Town Hall

This structure is the first building placed in village generation, and holds the village bell. It uses the farmhouse schematic. The town hall's placement specially adjusts itself to ensure that the exit is level compared to the ground. This is not done for other buildings to avoid collisions.

## Crop Farms

Standard crop farms that spawn melons, pumpkins, beetroot, carrots, potatoes or wheat. Always comes with a composter

## Animal Pens

Depending on the animals that spawn inside, animal pens will come with smokers, looms or fletching tables.

## Wells

Schematic spawned structures

## Fountains

## Pond

Small ponds that generate, sometimes with barrels. Ponds are generated dynamically and are their own local water level. Tropical Fish and sea pickles can spawn within ponds.
