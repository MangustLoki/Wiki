# Ancient City

Massive structures that spawn deep underground beneath mountains. This structure will only spawn in 1.19 and above due to the lack of key blocks that cannot be easily replaced in lower versions (e.g. sculk and specific loot tables) 

The way the ancient city in TerraformGenerator spawns is fairly different compared to vanilla. The plugin will almost always spawn the bulk of the structure above a steep drop, and the center of the ancient city will have very dense sculk coverage which thins out the further from the city you go. Each ancient city platform can house a range of different structures.

# Platform Types

These can spawn with randomised breakage. They tend to contain the most chests.

### Sculk Lamp

### Towers

# Inside the Center

Unlike Vanilla, the basement is below the entire central platform, not on the same level. The piston doors **do not** react to sound, and instead are jammed shut with a lever on the inside. This cannot be opened without explicitly breaking inside.

A very clear set of stairs will lead downwards to the shut piston doors on the central platform on one of the central head's facing directions. On some rare ocasions, edge-case spawning conditions may make the piston doors spawn open or semi-open.
