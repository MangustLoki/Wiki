# Monuments

![](https://i.imgur.com/WxboQVt.png)

Spawns Guardians and 3 Elder Guardians. Has randomised rooms, where some rooms have second levels. Second levels aren't connected together. The exterior will spawn large lamps and some wall designs. I'm not fully satisfied with the Monument. It may change a long time later. Monuments can spawn in 3 different aesthetic themes. It mainly affects the exterior (Less light, more light, more dark prismarine etc)

## Coral/Sponge room

A room that holds an elder guardian. Generally is carved into the second level. 

## Pillar Room

Just a room with a pillar in it.

## Dolphin Cage

Generally is carved into the second level. Spawns a prismarine cage with dolphins trapped inside. 

## Lamps

There are 3 variants of lamps that spawn with Monuments, each depending on the theme of the Monument that spawns.
